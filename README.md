# Introduction to Git and GitHub

Youâ€™ve probably heard of GitHub, but maybe you're not quite sure what it's all about. In this RC Primer*, we'll demystify the world of version control and introduce both Git and GitHub. 
We'll cover what these widely used tools are, when (and when not to) use them as part of your research process, and how to gain access to the Git software. We will then finish this talk 
by previewing common Git commands that are useful for those who are new to Git. You will need no prior knowledge in order to participate in this session.

* What is an RC Primer?: An RC Primer is a session that provides an introduction to concepts, systems, and tools. You can expect to leave a Primer with an introductory-level understanding of the topic.
